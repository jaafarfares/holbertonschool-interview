# 0x16. Rotate 2D Matrix




#### rotate_2d_matrix a function that rotates an n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise in-place. This means that the matrix should be modified directly without creating a new matrix.

#### The function takes the matrix as input and performs the following steps:
* It transposes the matrix by swapping the elements at corresponding positions across the diagonal. This effectively flips the matrix along its main diagonal.
* After transposing, it reverses each row of the transposed matrix, effectively rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
* The modified matrix is then ready for use.
* The function does not return anything; instead, it modifies the matrix in-place.
