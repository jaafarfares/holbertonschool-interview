# 0x1F-pascal_triangle

a python function called pascal_triangle(n) that generates Pascal's triangle up to the nth row. The function returns a list of lists of integers representing the triangle. If the input value n is less than or equal to 0, an empty list is returned. To accomplish this, the function iteratively constructs each row of the triangle, starting with the first row [1] and using the values from the previous row to calculate the next row. The provided print_triangle function is used to neatly print the resulting Pascal's triangle when the script is executed.
